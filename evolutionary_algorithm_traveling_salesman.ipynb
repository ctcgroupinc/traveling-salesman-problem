    "Look at that awesome path! When you just look at the cities with no path, it looks like a mess. With this algorithm in-place, now we can see an easy path and it looks so natural. On top of that, despite there being 10^64 permutations... this ran in just seconds and solved it for us. Now, this isn't the ABSOLUTE best answer, it's an approximation. It's possible that we're only close to the best answer. But that's a small price to pay for being able to answer the question so quickly."
